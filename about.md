Hello there! My name is Fiona Soetrisno and I am currently studying computer science at Cal Poly and minoring in Computing for Interactive Arts. This means that I do a bunch of art stuff and computer stuff ( wow shocker !! ), and I love making things look nice using code. I love love video games, I think they've shaped my life a lot, and I have a ton of fun making them. I love coding the logic and gameplay, as well as creating assets and 3d models, and making the game look good. I'm looking for internship pls feed me
