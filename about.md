I am currently a 3rd year Computer Science major at Cal Poly, minoring in Computing for Interactive Arts which encompasses 3D modeling, game design, and graphics. I have a passion for creating games and mixing coding and art to make beautiful scenes. 

Throughout the last couple years, I have interned at Valve on CS:GO, Microsoft on Minecraft, and Apple for web dev, and more info about my work at the companies can be found on my LinkedIn. During my free time I am a 2D artist and a jazz violinist. I have always loved art and music since a young age, so feel free to check out the art and music tabs above.

Currently looking for an Internship for Summer 2021, and I would love to be in contact! If there are any questions, please email me at: fiona.soetrisno@gmail.com.
