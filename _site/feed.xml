&lt;p&gt;The player on the computer has to run around and blend in with the other NPC’s while the player in the VR headset has to find the imposter. In the demo below, the left is the VR view while the right is the computer view. If the imposter is caught, then the VR player wins! If the VR player uses up their 3 tries, then the computer player wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, I used SteamVR for the Player CameraRig, Teleporting, and Grabbable Objects. I used raycasting for the shooting + laser, as well as Unity AI Navmesh and 3rd person character controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-the-game&quot;&gt;About the Game&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player has lost both their home and their memories. While working at the cafe, the player talks with the customers and helps them through their troubles, slowly learns about their own past, and works toward reconstructing their lost home world. Through multiple flashbacks and talking with your companion Jett, you learn that there is a seed capable of creating a new dimension–your old home. The goal of the game is to grow the seed by recieving items from talking to different characters that come to the cafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the game, you recieve records that you can place in the jukebox to transport you into different dimensions, ultimitely getting more customers to the cafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout your adventure, you talk with different characters from different dimensions and help them solve their problems. There are multiple options and routes you are able to choose, and having a better outcome for an NPC’s story gives you a better item. Make drinks for the characters in order to improve your relationship with them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also flashbacks that the player goes through to uncover more about their past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you recieve an item from each NPC character, you are able to feed the seed and finally create your home dimension. Depending on how well you do, there are different endings and dimensions that you can unlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-work-on-the-game&quot;&gt;My Work on the Game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acted as the main programmer for the game and implimented a lot of the gameplay features. Some of the things I worked on are the branching dialogue system, text and UI animations, overall game loop system, and the flashback system.
Initially we had such a large scope for the project, and branching dialogue needs a lot of systems to get it to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../assets/images/projects/intervalCafe/unityDialogue.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;img1&quot; class=&quot;img-smaller&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../assets/images/projects/intervalCafe/twineDialogue.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;img1&quot; class=&quot;img-smaller&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I also created several sprites for the game like the one below. In the dialogue system, characters can have different sprite emotions during dialogue, so all of the characters need sprites for all emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;view-the-code-on-my-github-demo-on-youtube&quot;&gt;View the code on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/faliona6/GraphicsFinalProj/tree/master/p5&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, demo on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0aZystn5YE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dolphin Friends is a low-poly dolphin “hide-and-seek” game made using C++ and OpenGL for CPE 471, Intro Graphics. The goal of the game is to find all of the dolphins in the least amount of time, and the dolphins follow you after you find them. Every time you collect a dolphin, they follow you, with collision detections on each other and the islands. Look underwater to find fish boids swimming around and other underwater fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../assets/images/projects/dolphinFriends/test-hero.gif&quot; alt=&quot;img1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing these shaders were a lot of fun, and it was my first time learning about and writing vert and frag shaders in glsl. I used Blinn-Phong shading texture mapping for the dolphins (they have white bellies), skybox, and GUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../assets/images/projects/dolphinFriends/terrain.png&quot; alt=&quot;img1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the water shader, I basically distorted all of the vertices of a flat plane in the vertex shader using sin and cos functions. However, I got to the problem where I had to update the normals after the vertices moved, so every vertex needed to know about the location of the other 2 vertices in the triangle. I passed in the positions of all vertices in the triangle into the vertex shader to do the calculations and went for a crystal water vibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anemone picks two random colors and blends between them, and the coral blends between blue and purple. The seaweed actually uses the same shader as the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../assets/images/projects/dolphinFriends/hero.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;img1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically organized my data similar to a very simple version of Unity GameObjects, where everything was a GameObject with a mesh, rigidbody, and transform.
The RigidBody kept track of the velocity, acceleration, friction, and does the physics updating. Rigidbodies also kept track of the bounds of each item for collisions, but I ended up just using sphere colliders for collision calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boids consist of red fish, seahorses, and my favorite fish, porygon. Velocity of each boid is based on the cohesion, alignment, and separation vectors. They have basic collision detection so that they don’t go out of the map and don’t go into the islands. The dolphins work very similar to the boids, except they only follow the player instead of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pit Stop is a 3D racing game where you collect gears to repair and upgrade your ship at the Pit Stops! The goal is to get to the giant golden gear, but you can’t reach it until you get at least the jump and boost upgrades. The police are chasing you because you’re stealing all of their gears. Your ship also breaks a bit if you run into things a lot, so spend 5 gears in the pit stop to repair your ship and gain some health back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a boost and jump upgrade, you can plant mines that explode and temporarily stun any enemy that hits it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game was made for Global Game Jam, so we had 48 hours to make the game. I did a lot of the game mechanics, such as player movement, enemy AI, boost and mine abilities, pit stop logic, and general game loop. I also worked on the particle effects for the ship, level design, and overall look of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the game jam, I spend around a day polishing it up and doing bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I really enjoy doing game jams and working in a team! For this project, Jaelyn did almost all of the models, such as the ship, police ships, and buildings. It’s always great to be able to work with both artists and programmers at game jams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please check out and play the game on itch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raytracer I built supported several features– rendering primitive shapes, 3d models, reflection, refraction, transformations, texturing, and emmissive materials. Below are some of the example outputs for my raytracer throughout the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used .ppm files as input to place the shapes and models in our 3D scene. I also created a C# script in Unity to create a ppm file based on shapes in the Unity 3D scene for easy placement, and I was able to create some fun renders with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-project---volumes&quot;&gt;Final Project - Volumes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my final project, I wanted to create participating media using my renderer. This inclues fog, clouds, smoke, etc. I learned about how light gets scattered within the material, and also implimented a ray marching technique to calculate the density at every point. I added parameters such as densityMultiplier, lightAbsorption, lightColor, and Perlin Noise seed in order to create different variations of clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PolyChicken follows a chicken wanting to meet up with the shining golden chicken. However, the chicken is not very smart and can only go in one direction! Guide the chicken using the arrows in your inventory to change the direction of the chicken and solve the puzzle. Along the way, the chicken loses stamina as it runs. You can replenish your stamina by collecting the baby chicks around the map (because of course every parent gets their stamina replenished when they are with their kids)! When the chicken is at a higher stamina, it goes faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game was created for my CSC 371 Game Design course in around three weeks. It was a fun and short project to work on. I enjoyed working on the level design and creating puzzles, so hopefully There are currently only three levels, but in the future I hope to add more levels and different mechanics to make the game more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I only had around three weeks to make the game, I used free 3D models from the Unity asset store. I did model the arrows and drew the icons for the UI. The music is from PikuNiku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be awesome if you could play the game and possibly leave feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Project: Catalyst, an experiment in which you will help me combine these unstable elements into a compound.
