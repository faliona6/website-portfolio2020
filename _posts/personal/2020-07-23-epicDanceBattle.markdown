# About the Short

Our 3D modeling class actually had nothing to do with animation, but for our final project, we decided to showcase our 3D model using a short. This was my first experience using Maya, and I designed and modeled "pink guy" (the pink bunny) and textured him in Substance Painter. I also did all of the cinematography work in Unity using Cinemachine. We used Mixamo for all of the animations.

To be honest, since we didn't know how to do any animations and they would probably turn out a bit janky, we tried to make the concept of the short comedic, including the character designs.

It was also my first time using Substance Painter, so I got to experiment with different texture maps, such as normal and rougness maps, to give my character more texture. I also got to experiment with post processing to make the scenes look nicer.
