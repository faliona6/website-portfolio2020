heroDescription: Boba is You is a recreation of the game Baba is You that I made for my Object Oriented Programming CPE 203 course in Java. It's a 2D puzzle game where the blocks around you spell out the rules of the game. Re-arrange the blocks to solve the puzzles and win the game!

# Demo

I highly recommend playing the game before watching the video of the playthrough since it is a puzzle game! But if not, here is a demo of the game.

# About the Game

It was really fun coding the logic of the game, and doing it in an object-oriented design made a lot of sense so it was a perfect idea for my final project. There are a lot of interesting rules that come out of the gameplay itself, such as playing as the wall.

I drew all of the pixel art myself as well with the intent to recreate the art style from the original game. Because I was using Java, I had to render all of the images myself and create a simple game engine. Overall, this project was fun to work on and if you like it, I highly recommend playing the original game Baba is You!
