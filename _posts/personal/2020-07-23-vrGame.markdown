heroDescription: For CSC 377, Mixed Reality, I created an Asymmetrical VR game with rules similar to Guess Who. One player is on the computer and tries to blend in with NPC's, while another player is in the headset and tries to find the other player. The VR player only gets 3 tries, otherwise it's game over!

# About the Project

The player on the computer has to run around and blend in with the other NPC's while the player in the VR headset has to find the imposter. In the demo below, the left is the VR view while the right is the computer view. If the imposter is caught, then the VR player wins! If the VR player uses up their 3 tries, then the computer player wins.

For this project, I used SteamVR for the Player CameraRig, Teleporting, and Grabbable Objects. I used raycasting for the shooting + laser, as well as Unity AI Navmesh and 3rd person character controller.
