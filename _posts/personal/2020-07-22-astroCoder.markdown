heroDescription: Project Catalyst was made for College Game Jam 2021. The goal was to create a fun game around the theme of connections. We wanted to add a bit of chemistry into the game, so you go around combining different elements together. The game was made by Fiona Soetrisno, John Manard, Worblir, Megan Belle Maun, and Lauren Nakamura.

# How to Play
## To play the game, view it on my [itch.io][itch-link] page! 

Welcome to Project: Catalyst, an experiment in which you will help me combine these unstable elements into a compound. My tether gun can connect these elements, and once you connect them in the recipes specified by the list on the right, we will move onto our next set! If you mess up, you can right-click your mouse to shoot an anti-tether to disconnect all tethers from the element hit by the end of the tether gun.

# About the Game

In this project, I worked on the player controller and animations, enemy AI, health system, and environment design.
