AstroCode VR is an Oculus Rift Game that teaches the player how to code in a fun and exciting way. The game is set in a kid's room in which the player's imagined astronaut is stranded away from earth. Players must connect blocks of code together to write programs that will move their astronaut character back to earth.

# About the Game

We were working in a team of 4 students for the hackathon. I did a lot of the level design, the building of the room, and 3D modeling the blocks and some furniture.
