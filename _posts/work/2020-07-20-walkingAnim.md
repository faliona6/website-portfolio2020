heroDescription: Due to interesting COVID-19 circumstances, I got the chance to try out some 3D animation for the first time. This is my first walk cycle animation using Valve's Antimage character rig from Dota2.

Doing a remote internship was definitely an interesting experience, and due to my first mentor having to take leave, I got to work with an animator at Valve instead. I had no 3D animation experience prior, but it was a great opportunity to learn how rigs and animation work in games. The animation isn't used in-game, and was only used as an opportunity for me to get started with 3D animation.

The only thing I created was the animation for the walk cycle, and the character, rig, and cloth animations all belong to Dota/Valve.
